*** About Google Site Search module
---------------------------------------
Google Site Search uses the Google API to search one or more sites.
A Search engine unique ID is required to use this module.

The difference in this module, compared to other such as Google CSE,
is that search results are completely customized and will not appear in an
iframe, but directly in the site's HTML code.
This requires "Site Search Edition" (paid version of Google's Custom Search).


*** Use Google Site Search
---------------------------------------
- Module settings
  1. Go to Admin > Settings > Google Site Search.
  2. Put your unique ID in the "Search engine unique ID" field. Note that the ID
     must to be "Site Search Edition" (paid version of Google's Custom Search).

- Module behavior
  If the module is enabled and an unique ID is given, the module will take over
  the search functionality on the site.
