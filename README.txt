*** About Google Site Search module
---------------------------------------
Google Site Search uses the Google API to search one or more sites.
A Google API key is required to use this module.

The difference in this module, compared to other such as Google CSE,
is that search results are completely customized and will not appear in an
iframe, but directly in the site's HTML code.
This requires "Site Search Edition" (paid version of Google's Custom Search).


*** Use Google Site Search
---------------------------------------
- Module settings
  1. Go to Admin > Settings > Google Site Search.
  2. Put your Google API key in the "API Key" field. Note that the key
     must to be "Site Search Edition" (paid version of Google's Custom Search).

- Module behavior
  If the module is enabled and an API key is given, the module will take over
  the search functionality on the site.
