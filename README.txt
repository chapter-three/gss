INTRODUCTION
------------

Google Site Search uses the Google API to search one or more sites.
A Search engine unique ID is required to use this module.

The difference in this module, compared to other such as Google CSE,
is that search results are completely customized and will not appear in an
iframe, but directly in the site's HTML code.
This requires "Site Search Edition" (paid version of Google's Custom Search).


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Module settings:
 * Go to Configuration > Search and metadata > Search settings
 * Go to the Google Site Search group (this group shows only if the module is
   active).
 * Put your unique ID in the "Search engine unique ID" field. Note that the ID
   must to be "Site Search Edition" (paid version of Google's Custom Search).

Search settings:
 * Go to Configuration > Search and metadata > Search settings.
 * In the Active search modules group, enable "Google Site Search".
 * If you want, you can set the Google Site Search as default in "Default search
   module" in the same page.
